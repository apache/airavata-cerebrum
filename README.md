# Apache Airavata Cerebrum, an Integrated Neuroscience Computational Framework

## Introduction

Welcome to the Apache Airavata Cerebrum repository for the Integrated Neuroscience Computational Framework. This project aims to revolutionize how we understand and model the human brain by integrating cellular-level brain atlases with advanced computational tools. Our goal is to create a cohesive, open-source framework that allows for the seamless application of existing tools within a streamlined, lightweight environment.

## Features

- **Integration of Brain Atlases**: Merging publicly available cellular-level brain atlases into a single, accessible platform.
- **Comprehensive Modeling Tools**: Incorporating computational tools designed for modeling the entire brain.
- **Open-Source Framework**: Developing a user-friendly, open-source environment for neuroscience research.
- **Streamlined Environment**: Ensuring a lightweight, efficient framework for both beginners and advanced users.

# Try Airavata Cerebrum
Airavata Cerebrum requires python3.10+ environment. It is currently tested only in Linux operating system.
We recommend create a virtual environment using conda as below:
```
conda create -n cerebrum python=3.10
conda activate cerebrum
```

### Download and Install

Following command will download Airavata Cerebrum into your environment. 
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/apache/airavata-cerebrum.git
```
